 all of the branches/blocks of an if expression need to contain values of the same type.

 a switch case can name the value or values it matches to temporary constants or variables that are bound within the respective cases' body

 tuple values from anotherPoint. The first case, case (let x, 0), matches any point with a y value of 0
 and assigns the pointâ€™s x value to the temporary constant x. Similarly, the second case, case (0, let y),
 matches any point with an x value of 0 and assigns the pointâ€™s y value to the temporary constant y.

 break in a switch statement

 this behavior can be used to match and ignore one or more cases in a switch statement. Because Swiftâ€™s switch statement is exhaustive and doesnâ€™t allow empty cases, itâ€™s sometimes necessary to deliberately match and ignore a case in order to make your intentions explicit

 defer lets you control when a piece of code is executed. You use a defer block to write code that will be executed when the program reaches the end of the current scope

 then, before exiting the if statementâ€™s scope, the deferred code is run, which prints score.
 
 the code inside the defer always runs, regardless of how the program exits that scope
 this behavior makes defer useful for operations where you need to guarantee a pair of actions happen â€” like manually allocating and freeing memory, opening and closing low-level file descriptors, and beginning and ending transactions in a database â€” because you can write both actions next to each other in your code
 if you write more than one defer block in the same scope, the first one you specify is the last one to run
