// Strings are Value Types
/*
 if you create a new String value, that String value is copied when passed to a function or method,
 or when its assigned to a constant or variable.
 In each case, a new copy of the existing String value is created, and the new copy is passed or assigned,
 not the original version
 Swift's copy-by-default String behavious ensures that when a function or method passes you a String value,
 it is clear you own that exact String value, regardless of where it came from.
 Hence the string passed won't be modified unless you modify it yourself
 */


// Working with Characters

// one can access the individual Character values for a String by iterating over the string with a for-in loop
for character in "Kenyan" {
    print(character)
}

// create a stand-alone character variable or constant
var period: Character = "."

// string values can be constructed by passing an array of Character values as an argument to its initializer
let catCharacters: [Character] = ["C","a","t"]

// stringOne = "hello world"

// one can append a Character value to a String variable with the String type's append() method
let exclamationMark: Character = "!"
welcomeToTheWorld.append(exclamationMark)


// String interpolation
/*
 string interpolation is a way to construct a new String value from a mix of
 constants, variables, literals, and expressions by including their values inside a string literal.
 one can use string interpolation in both single-line and multi-line comments
 */

let message = "\(multiplier) times 2.5 is \(Double(multiplier) * 2.5)"

// one can use extended string delimiters to create strings containing characters that would otherwise be treated as a string interpolation

// Unicode
// it is an international standard for encoding, representing, and processing text in different writing systems
// it enables one to represent almost any character from any language in a standardized form, and to read and write those characters to and from an external source such as a text file or web page
// Swift's String and Character types are fully Unicode-compliant


// Unicode Scalar Values
/*
 behind the scenes, Swift's native String type is built from Unicode scalar values.
 a unicode scalar value is a unique 21-bit number for a character or modifier,
 such as U+0061 for LATIN SMALL LETTER A ("a"), or U+1F425 for FRONT-FACING BABY CHICK ("üê•").
 
 not all 21-bit unicode scalar values are assigned to a character - some are reserved for future assignment or for use in UTF-16 encoding
 */


// Extended Grapheme Clusters
/*
 every instance of Swift's Character type represents a single extended grapheme cluster
 an extended grapheme cluster is a sequence of one or more unicode scalars that when combined produce a single human-readable character
 */

// in both cases below, the letter √© is represented as a single Swift Character value that represents an extended grapheme cluster.
// in the first case, the cluster contains a single scalar; in the second case, it‚Äôs a cluster of two scalars:
let eAcute: Character = "\u{E9}"                         // √©
let combinedEAcute: Character = "\u{65}\u{301}"          // e followed by
// eAcute is √©, combinedEAcute is eÃÅ

// extended grapheme clusters are a flexible way to represent many complex script characters as a single Character value e.g. Hangul syllables from the Korean alphabet
let precomposed: Character = "\u{D55C}"                  // Ìïú
let decomposed: Character = "\u{1112}\u{1161}\u{11AB}"   // ·Ñí, ·Ö°, ·Ü´
// precomposed is Ìïú, decomposed is ·Ñí·Ö°·Ü´

// Unicode scalars for regional indicator symbols can be combined in pairs to make a single Character value, such as this combination of REGIONAL INDICATOR SYMBOL LETTER U (U+1F1FA) and REGIONAL INDICATOR SYMBOL LETTER S (U+1F1F8):
let regionalIndiactorForUS: Character = "\u{1F1FA}\u{1F1F8}"
// regionalIndicatorForUS is üá∫üá∏


// Counting Characters
// to retrieve a count of the Character values in a string, use the count property of the string
// it also counts the whitespaces
let myNameCombined = "Lee, Leonard, Sangoroh"
print(myNameCombined.count) // output is 22

/*
 Swift's use of extended grapheme clusters for Character values means that string modification may not always affect a string's character count.
 e.g. initialize a string with 4 character count, then append a COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT (U+0301) to the end of the string, the resulting string will still have a character cound of 4, with a fourth character of eÃÅ, not e
 */
var word = "cafe"
print("the number of characters in \(word) is \(word.count)")
// Prints "the number of characters in cafe is 4"


word += "\u{301}"    // COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT, U+0301


print("the number of characters in \(word) is \(word.count)")
// Prints "the number of characters in cafeÃÅ is 4"


/*
Extended grapheme clusters can be composed of multiple Unicode scalars. This means that different characters ‚Äî
 and different representations of the same character ‚Äî can require different amounts of memory to store. Because
 of this, characters in Swift don‚Äôt each take up the same amount of memory within a string‚Äôs representation. As
 a result, the number of characters in a string can‚Äôt be calculated without iterating through the string to
 determine its extended grapheme cluster boundaries. If you are working with particularly long string values, be
 aware that the count property must iterate over the Unicode scalars in the entire string in order to determine
 the characters for that string.
 */


// Accessing and Modifying a String


// String Indices
/*
 Each String value has an associated index type, String.Index, which corresponds to the position of each Character in the string
 Since different characters require different amounts of memory because of extended grapheme clusters, in order to determine which Character is at a particular position, one must iterate over each Unicode scalar from the start or end of that String.
 For this reason, Swift strings can't be indexed by integer values

// all above properties such as startIndex can be used on any type that conforms to the RangeReplaceableCollection protocol
// This includes String, as well as collection types such as Array, Dictionary, and Set


// Substrings
// this is part of an existing string
// similar to strings, with one major difference
// they refer to the original string they were cut out from until they are assigned converted from substriing to an instance of String
let gggreeting = "Hello, world!"

let newString = String(beginning)

// substrings aren‚Äôt suitable for long-term storage ‚Äî because they reuse the storage of the original string, the entire original string must be kept in memory as long as any of its substrings are being used.


// Comparing Strings

// there are three ways to compare textual values;
/*
 string and character equality
 prefix equality
 suffix equality
 */

// String & Character Equality
// it is checked with the equal to operator(==) and the not equal to operator (!=)

// OUTPUT
// We are not equal

// strings are considered equal if there extended grapheme clusters are canonically equivalent.
// extended grapheme clusters are canonically equivalent if they have the same linguistic meaning and appearance, even if they are composed from unicode scalars behind the scenes
// For example, LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH ACUTE (U+00E9) is canonically equivalent to LATIN SMALL LETTER E (U+0065) followed by COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT (U+0301). Both of these extended grapheme clusters are valid ways to represent the character √©, and so they‚Äôre considered to be canonically equivalent

// Prefix and Suffix Equality
// to check whether a string has a particular string prefix or suffix, call the string‚Äôs hasPrefix(_:) and hasSuffix(_:) methods, both of which take a single argument of type String and return a Boolean value.

// Unicode Representations of Strings

/*
 When a Unicode string is written to a text file or some other storage, the Unicode scalars in that string are
 encoded in one of several Unicode-defined encoding forms. Each form encodes the string in small chunks known as
 code units. These include the UTF-8 encoding form (which encodes a string as 8-bit code units), the UTF-16
 encoding form (which encodes a string as 16-bit code units), and the UTF-32 encoding form (which encodes a
 string as 32-bit code units).
