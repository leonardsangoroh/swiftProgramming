// Collection Types
// they store a collection of values
/*
 // REFER TO 'ArraySetDict' IMAGE IN RESOURCES FOLDER
 The three main collection types are
 - arrays - ordered collection of values
 - sets - unordered collection of unique values
 - dictionaries - unordered collections of key-value associations
 */


// Mutability of Collections
/*
 all can be changed or mutated after its creation.
 this change can be through adding, removing, or changing items in the collection
 if assigned to a constant (using let), then the collection is unmutatable
*/


// Arrays
/*
 stores values of the same type in an ordered list
 the same value can appear in an array multiple times at different positions
 
 Swift's Array type is bridged to Foundation's NSArray class
 the statement above means that when you use Swift's native array type (Array), it can be automatically
 converted to an NSArray object when interacting with Objective-C APIs that expect an NSArray. This
 seamless bridging allows Swift code to work with Objective-C APIs that use arrays without needing
 explicit conversions, making interoperability between Swift and Objective-C smoother and more natural.
 Similarly, Objective-C arrays (NSArray) can be automatically bridged to Swift arrays when imported into
 Swift code.

// Sets
/*
 a set stores distinct values of the same type in a collection with no defined ordering.
 one can use a set instead of an array when order of items is not important, or when each item in a collection needs to appear only once

 */

// Hash Values for Set Types
/*
 a type must be hashable in order to be stored in a set
 hashable - the type must provide a way to compute a hash value for itself.
 a hash value is an Int value that's the same for all objects that compare equally
 all of Swift's basic types (String, Int, Double, Bool) are hashable, hence can be used as set value types or dictionary key types. Enumeration case values without associated values are also hashable by default
 
 one can also use their own custome types as set value types or dictionary key types by making them conform to the Hashable protocol from the Swift Standard Library
